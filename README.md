# **My Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Projects**

This repository contains all the projects and exercises I worked on while following along with **"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"** by **Al Sweigart**. It serves as a record of my progress, a resource for anyone interested in learning automation with Python, and a showcase of practical applications of Python for everyday tasks.

## **Introduction**

This repository includes my personal implementations of projects from the book. Each script is a practical application of Python to automate tedious or repetitive tasks, such as:
- File and folder organization
- Text processing
- Spreadsheet manipulation
- Web scraping
- GUI automation

These projects were an invaluable learning experience and are designed to be beginner-friendly. They also demonstrate how Python can be used in everyday scenarios to save time and effort.
